This little read me is just to point out how to add the mod to your game. 
all you have to do is add it to your mods folder in the root dir of your game. 
if you havent installed it someplace else it would go here.

C:\Program Files\THQ\Gas Powered Games

if you do not have a mod folder all you have to do is add one. 

here is a bit of back ground about the mod, Its my first its not compleate this is only v.1 
later i plan on changeing some of the units around and adding more so the t1 land building only makes 
ones that move on land the ship yard makes boats that can build on water only or land next to water.
and of course the flying engineers can build every where. 

please do not upload this to any other place unless you ask me first, and if you do please dont change the read me.
im very proud of this mod beeing as its my first it may be simple but its still my first one. thank you for chooseing my mod
i hope you enjoy it.
